# Phase Validation Decisions

## Walking Skeleton Phase Validation - 2025-01-02

**Decision**: ✅ PROCEED

**What Was Accomplished**:
- Created template CLAUDE.md that works across project types
- Updated README with clear step-by-step usage instructions
- Tested AI integration - Claude can understand and follow workflow
- Established minimal but complete workflow distribution system
- Deployed to GitHub: https://github.com/knightstick/claude-workflow
- Validated end-to-end user journey (copy files → customize → AI guidance)

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Template-based approach: Single CLAUDE.md template customizable for any project
- File-copying distribution: Simple, no complex setup required
- GitHub as deployment platform: Free, accessible, familiar to developers
- Markdown-based system: Version controllable, AI-readable, platform independent

**Quality Assessment**:
- Code Quality: Production-ready templates and documentation
- Architecture: Solid foundation for building additional templates and features
- Documentation: Clear instructions, tested workflow
- Deployment: Successfully deployed and accessible

**Key Learnings**:
- Template CLAUDE.md approach works - AI can understand and follow methodology
- Simple file copying is sufficient for distribution
- Systematic questioning scripts provide good AI guidance structure
- Human validation framework effectively guides phase decisions

**Next Phase Planning**:
- Success criteria: Build first MVC phase template
- Priority features: MVC template, phase tracking, additional AI scripts
- Potential risks: Template complexity, maintaining consistency across phases

**Future Self Notes**:
- Walking Skeleton proved the core concept works
- Focus on keeping templates simple and AI-readable
- Human validation checkpoints are critical for maintaining quality
- GitHub repository provides good visibility and sharing mechanism
