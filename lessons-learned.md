# Lessons Learned: Dogfooding the Claude Workflow

*Key insights from applying our own phased development methodology to build the workflow system itself.*

## Overview

This document captures lessons learned from **dogfooding** our own workflow methodology. We applied the GitLab Product Development Flow (adapted for solo developers + AI) to build the very workflow system we were designing. This meta-approach provided valuable insights into the methodology's strengths, challenges, and practical implementation considerations.

## What We Built

**Project**: A structured, research-backed workflow system for solo developers working with AI coding assistants.

**Methodology Applied**: GitLab Product Development Flow adapted for solo development:
- Problem Validation → Solution Validation → Walking Skeleton → Incremental Development → Track Phase
- Human validation at end of every phase
- AI-assisted questioning and decision-making
- Research-driven design decisions

## Phase-by-Phase Lessons

### Problem Validation Phase Insights

**What Worked Well**:
- Starting with user's actual pain point ("I want to create a repository...to use when building things with Claude Code") provided clear direction
- The 30-60 minute timeframe was realistic for validating core problem
- AI-assisted questioning helped explore problem dimensions systematically

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Initial scope was too broad - needed to narrow to specific workflow patterns
- Balancing problem validation with solution ideation was tricky
- Solo developer context meant limited external validation sources

**Key Learning**: Problem validation for meta-projects (building tools for yourself) requires careful separation of "what you think you need" vs "what you actually need." The structured questioning helped maintain this discipline.

### Solution Validation Phase Insights

**What Worked Well**:
- Research-first approach provided solid foundation for solution design
- Breaking down into discrete components (templates, scripts, documentation) made validation manageable
- Technical feasibility was easier to assess due to familiarity with target technologies

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Competitive analysis was limited since this specific niche is relatively new
- User validation was challenging as a meta-project - we were both user and developer
- Solution scope kept expanding as we discovered additional requirements

**Key Learning**: For workflow/tooling projects, solution validation should focus heavily on technical feasibility and integration with existing developer workflows. User validation can leverage analogous examples from similar tools.

### Walking Skeleton Phase Insights

**What Worked Well**:
- The git repository with basic README established clear project foundation
- Incremental commits provided good progress visibility
- Research papers provided immediate value and validated the approach
- Template-based approach proved scalable across different project types

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Initial skeleton was too minimal - needed more structure upfront
- Balancing "minimal" with "useful" was harder than expected
- Documentation overhead was higher than anticipated

**Key Learning**: For infrastructure/tooling projects, the Walking Skeleton should include enough structure to be immediately usable, even if features are minimal. Pure minimalism can be less valuable than structured minimalism.

### Incremental Development (MVC) Phase Insights

**What Worked Well**:
- 1-2 hour timeboxes kept features focused and completable
- Each phase template built logically on previous work
- AI assistance was particularly valuable for creating structured templates
- Human validation checkpoints prevented scope creep

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Template creation took longer than expected (closer to 2-4 hours per template)
- Maintaining consistency across templates required careful attention
- Balancing completeness with simplicity in templates was ongoing challenge

**Key Learning**: MVC timeframes may need adjustment based on work type. Creative/design work (like template creation) may require longer blocks than pure implementation work.

### Track Phase Application

**What We're Tracking**:
- Template completeness and usability
- Workflow applicability to real projects
- Documentation clarity and effectiveness
- Time investment vs value delivered

**Early Indicators**:
- ✅ Complete GitLab methodology implementation achieved
- ✅ Templates provide clear structure and AI guidance
- ✅ Workflow is immediately applicable to new projects
- ✅ Research foundation supports design decisions

## Methodology Effectiveness Assessment

### Strengths Observed

**Structure Without Rigidity**:
- Phases provided clear progression without feeling constraining
- Human validation gates prevented autopilot development
- AI integration enhanced rather than replaced human decision-making

**Research-Driven Development**:
- Starting with research papers provided solid foundation
- Evidence-based decisions reduced second-guessing
- Academic backing increased confidence in approach

**Incremental Progress**:
- Each phase produced tangible artifacts
- Regular commits provided progress visibility
- Small wins maintained motivation throughout development

**AI-Human Collaboration**:
- AI excelled at generating structured content (templates, questions)
- Human validation was essential for strategic decisions
- Combined approach was more effective than either alone

### Challenges Identified

**Time Estimation Accuracy**:
- Initial estimates were often optimistic
- Creative work took longer than implementation work
- Template creation required more iteration than expected

**Scope Creep Management**:
- Easy to expand phase scope when excited about progress
- Human validation checkpoints were crucial for scope control
- "Just one more thing" syndrome required active management

**Documentation Overhead**:
- More documentation required than initially expected
- Balance between "just enough" and "comprehensive" was tricky
- Template quality required significant attention to detail

**Meta-Project Complexity**:
- Building methodology while using methodology created circular challenges
- Self-validation was more difficult than external validation
- Distinguishing between "what we want" and "what works" required discipline

## Key Success Factors
