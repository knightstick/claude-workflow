# Research Paper: GitLab's Approach to New vs Existing Systems Development

## Overview

GitLab's product development methodology applies consistent validation principles across both new and existing features, but with differentiated approaches based on the feature's maturity stage and risk profile.

## Core Development Framework

### Universal Principles
- **Validation-First Approach**: All features, new or existing, follow validation → build track progression
- **Risk-Based Staging**: Features progress through experimental → beta → general availability based on validation
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: PM, UX, Engineering, and Quality teams collaborate regardless of feature type

### Two-Track System Application

#### Validation Track (Applied to Both New and Existing)
- **Problem Validation**: Validates customer problems before solutioning
- **Solution Validation**: Validates proposed solutions meet business goals and technical feasibility
- **Continuous Re-validation**: Even existing features undergo validation when enhanced

#### Build Track (Differentiated by Feature Type)
- **New Features**: Full development lifecycle with staged rollout
- **Existing Features**: Enhancement cycles with impact assessment

## Development Stage Framework

### Stage Categories
GitLab categorizes all features into development stages with different validation requirements:

#### 1. Experimental Features (New Feature Testing)
**Purpose**: Early testing and validation of completely new concepts
**Characteristics**:
- Opt-in only (minimal friction to access)
- Allowed to "make mistakes and literally experiment"
- Behind feature flags that are off by default
- Limited production readiness requirements

**Validation Approach**:
- Rapid iteration and learning
- User feedback collection
- Technical proof of concept validation
- Market fit assessment

#### 2. Beta Features (Pre-Production Validation)
**Purpose**: Validation of features approaching production readiness
**Characteristics**:
- Behind feature flags that are on by default
- Behind toggles that are off by default
- Must complete Production Readiness Review process
- All sections up to beta in readiness template

**Validation Requirements**:
- Comprehensive testing at scale
- Performance and reliability validation
- Security assessment
- User experience validation

#### 3. General Availability (Production Features)
**Purpose**: Fully validated and supported features
**Characteristics**:
- Available to all users
- Full production support
- Complete documentation
- Comprehensive monitoring

## New Systems vs Existing Systems Differentiation

### New Systems (Greenfield) Approach
**Validation Intensity**: Higher validation requirements due to unknown factors
**Development Process**:
1. **Problem Validation**: Extensive customer research and market validation
2. **Solution Validation**: Multiple solution iterations and technical feasibility assessment
3. **Experimental Phase**: Controlled testing with limited user groups
4. **Beta Phase**: Broader testing with production-like conditions
5. **General Availability**: Full rollout with comprehensive support

**Key Considerations**:
- Complete architectural freedom
- Higher risk tolerance in experimental phase
- Extensive user research required
- Multiple validation cycles before production

### Existing Systems (Brownfield) Enhancement
**Validation Focus**: Impact assessment on existing functionality
**Development Process**:
1. **Impact Validation**: Assess effect on existing users and workflows
2. **Solution Validation**: Ensure compatibility with existing architecture
3. **Feature Flag Deployment**: Gradual rollout to minimize risk
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor impact on existing system performance

**Key Considerations**:
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Existing user workflow preservation
- Integration with current architecture
- Performance impact assessment

## Specialized Validation Approaches

### AI Features (Example of New System Category)
**Enhanced Validation Requirements**:
- **Centralized Evaluation Framework (CEF)**: Thousands of prompts across dozens of use cases
- **Daily Re-validation**: Continuous performance assessment during development
- **Scale Testing**: Large and diverse dataset evaluation
- **Multi-Phase Rollout**: Internal teams → gradual expansion → full availability

**Unique Considerations**:
- Model performance validation
- Content quality assessment
- Bias and safety evaluation
- Integration with existing workflows

### Feature Flag Lifecycle (Applied to Both)
**Purpose**: Safely introduce changes that could affect existing functionality
**Process**:
1. **Development**: Behind disabled feature flag
2. **Internal Testing**: Enabled for GitLab team
3. **Beta Testing**: Enabled for selected users
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Percentage-based rollout
5. **Full Availability**: Feature flag removed

## Exit Criteria and Decision Framework

### Time-Based Criteria
- **Experimental**: Defined end date for progression decision
- **Beta**: Time-bound target metrics (e.g., retention rates, growth metrics)
- **General Availability**: Sustained performance over defined period

### Performance-Based Criteria
- **New Features**: User adoption, feedback scores, technical performance
- **Existing Features**: No regression in key metrics, user satisfaction maintenance

### Business Impact Criteria
- **New Features**: Market validation, revenue potential, strategic alignment
- **Existing Features**: User value enhancement, operational efficiency, competitive advantage

## Risk Management Differences

### New Systems Risk Profile
- **Higher Uncertainty**: Unknown user adoption patterns
- **Technical Risk**: Unproven architecture and integrations
- **Market Risk**: Uncertain value proposition
- **Mitigation**: Extensive validation phases, gradual rollout

### Existing Systems Risk Profile
- **Regression Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **User Disruption**: Changing familiar workflows
- **Performance Impact**: Affecting system stability
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, feature flags, rollback capabilities

## Methodology Insights for Single-Developer Workflow

### Scalable Patterns
- **Stage-Based Validation**: Apply experimental → beta → GA progression to solo projects
- **Feature Flag Mentality**: Build rollback capabilities even in solo development
- **Continuous Validation**: Regular assessment of feature value and performance

### Adaptation for Solo Development
- **Simplified Validation**: Streamlined versions of GitLab's validation processes
- **Rapid Iteration**: Shorter phase durations appropriate for solo scale
- **Risk Tolerance**: Higher tolerance for experimentation in solo context

### AI-Assisted Implementation
- **Validation Scripts**: AI can help create testing and validation frameworks
- **Decision Trees**: AI can guide through stage progression decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: AI can help identify potential issues with new vs existing features

## Key Takeaways

1. **Universal Validation Principle**: Both new and existing features require validation, but with different focus areas
2. **Stage-Based Progression**: All features progress through maturity stages with specific criteria
3. **Risk-Proportionate Process**: Validation intensity scales with feature risk and novelty
4. **Continuous Assessment**: Even production features undergo continuous validation for enhancements
5. **Feature Flag Strategy**: Essential for both new features and existing feature modifications

## Application to Walking Skeleton + MVC Workflow

### Walking Skeleton Application
- **New Projects**: Full experimental → beta → GA progression
- **Existing Projects**: Focus on integration and compatibility validation

### MVC Application
- **New Features**: Follow complete validation track
- **Existing Feature Enhancement**: Streamlined validation focused on impact assessment
