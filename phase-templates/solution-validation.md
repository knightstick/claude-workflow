# Solution Validation Phase Template

*Validate that proposed solutions meet business goals and are technically feasible before building.*

## Phase Overview

**Goal**: Design and validate solutions that effectively address the validated problem while being technically feasible and differentiated from existing options.

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes (time-boxed)

**Prerequisites**: Completed Problem Validation with validated problem statement

**Success Criteria**: 
- Clear solution approach that addresses the validated problem
- Evidence that target users would adopt this solution
- Technical feasibility validated through research and prototyping
- Solution differentiation and competitive advantage identified
- Go/no-go decision based on solution validation evidence

## Research Foundation

Based on **GitLab Product Development Flow research**:
- "Product Designer leads the team in ideating about potential solutions"
- "Determine whether the proposed solution meets business goals and is technically feasible"
- "If the result is to move forward and solve the problem, move to design and solution validation"
- "Validate that the solutions meet users' needs"

Based on **Walking Skeleton Methodology research**:
- Solutions should enable minimal end-to-end implementation
- Technical feasibility must be validated before building
- Architecture choices should support incremental development

## Phase Activities

### 1. Solution Ideation and Design

#### Solution Brainstorming
**AI Prompt**: "Help generate multiple solution approaches for the validated problem."

**Ideation Process**:
- Generate 5-10 different solution approaches
- Include both obvious and creative solutions
- Consider different technology approaches
- Think about different user experience models
- Include solutions with varying complexity levels

**Solution Criteria**:
- Directly addresses the validated problem
- Feasible for solo developer + AI implementation
- Differentiable from existing solutions
- Can be implemented incrementally (Walking Skeleton â†’ MVCs)

#### Solution Specification
**AI Prompt**: "Help specify the most promising solution approach in detail."

**Solution Design Elements**:
- **Core Functionality**: What will the solution actually do?
- **User Experience**: How will users interact with the solution?
- **Technology Approach**: What technical components are needed?
- **Integration Points**: How does it fit into users' existing workflows?
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure if the solution works?

### 2. Technical Feasibility Assessment

#### Architecture Validation
**AI Prompt**: "Assess the technical feasibility of this solution approach."

**Technical Questions**:
- What are the core technical components required?
- Do you have the skills to implement these components?
- What external services or APIs would be needed?
- What are the potential technical risks or blockers?
- How complex would the initial implementation be?

#### Technology Stack Assessment
**AI Prompt**: "Help evaluate technology choices for implementing this solution."

**Stack Evaluation**:
- **Frontend Requirements**: What user interface needs exist?

- **Technical Feasibility**: Quick research on implementation approach
- **Value Assessment**: Validate the core value proposition makes sense

#### User Validation Script
**AI Prompt**: "Create interview script to validate solution approach with users."

**Solution Interview Questions**:
1. "Based on our previous conversation about [problem], I'd like to show you a potential solution"
2. "What's your initial reaction to this approach?"
3. "How would this fit into your current workflow?"
4. "What concerns would you have about using something like this?"
5. "How does this compare to [existing solution] that you mentioned?"
6. "What would convince you to try this solution?"
7. "What would make you stop using this solution?"

### 4. Competitive Differentiation Analysis

#### Competitive Solution Analysis
**AI Prompt**: "Analyze how this solution compares to existing alternatives."

**Competitive Assessment**:
- **Direct Competitors**: Solutions that solve the same problem
- **Indirect Competitors**: Alternative approaches users might take
- **Substitute Solutions**: Different ways users might address the need
- **Differentiation Factors**: What makes this solution unique/better
- **Competitive Advantages**: Sustainable advantages over alternatives

- **Target User Fit**: Why this is especially good for target users
- **Adoption Drivers**: What would motivate users to switch

### 5. Business Model and Viability

#### Solution Viability Assessment
**AI Prompt**: "Assess the business viability of this solution approach."

**Viability Questions**:
- How would this solution be monetized (if commercial)?
- What would be the ongoing maintenance requirements?
- How would you reach and acquire users?
- What would be the development and operational costs?
- Is this viable as a solo developer project?

#### Resource Requirements Analysis
**AI Prompt**: "Analyze the resources required to build and maintain this solution."

**Resource Assessment**:
- **Development Time**: Realistic estimate for initial version
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Time required to keep solution running
- **Technical Skills**: Any skills you'd need to learn
- **External Dependencies**: Services, APIs, or tools required
- **Support Requirements**: User support and documentation needs

### 6. Solution Validation Testing

#### Validation Execution
**AI Prompt**: "Guide execution of solution validation research with target users."

**Validation Process**:
1. **Recruit Participants**: Same users from problem validation ideally
2. **Prepare Materials**: Solution concepts, prototypes, or demos
3. **Conduct Sessions**: Interview users about solution approach
4. **Gather Feedback**: Document reactions, concerns, and suggestions
5. **Test Assumptions**: Validate key assumptions about user adoption

#### Validation Analysis
**AI Prompt**: "Analyze validation results to determine solution viability."

**Analysis Framework**:
- **User Reaction**: Do users understand and appreciate the solution?
- **Adoption Intent**: Would users actually use this solution?
- **Workflow Fit**: Does it integrate well into user processes?
- **Switching Likelihood**: Would users switch from current solutions?
