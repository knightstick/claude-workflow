# Problem Validation Phase Template

*Validate that this project solves a real problem for real users before investing in solutions.*

## Phase Overview

**Goal**: Establish and validate customer problems before moving to solution development.

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes (time-boxed)

**Prerequisites**: Initial project idea or opportunity identified

**Success Criteria**: 
- Clear problem statement in customer language
- Evidence that the problem exists and is significant
- Validation that target users actually have this problem
- Understanding of problem impact and urgency
- Decision to proceed, pivot, or stop based on evidence

## Research Foundation

Based on **GitLab Product Development Flow research**:
- "Good product development starts with a well understood and clearly articulated customer problem"
- "Validation opportunities should be captured in customer problem language"
- "Avoid jumping ahead to feature/solution language"
- "If we don't have confidence in the problem, continue validation cycles"

Based on **Solo Developer Documentation Strategy research**:
- Focus on decisions that save future time and effort
- Document evidence and reasoning for future self
- Keep validation lightweight but systematic

## Phase Activities

### 1. Problem Discovery and Definition

#### Problem Statement Development
**AI Prompt**: "Help me articulate the core problem this project should solve."

**Key Questions**:
- What specific problem are you trying to solve?
- Who experiences this problem? (Be specific about user groups)
- When and how often does this problem occur?
- What are people doing now to solve this problem (if anything)?
- Why is this problem worth solving?

**Output**: Clear problem statement that:
- Describes the problem in user/customer language
- Avoids solution or feature descriptions
- Identifies specific user groups affected
- Explains the current impact of the problem

#### User Group Identification
**AI Prompt**: "Help identify and validate the specific users who have this problem."

**User Analysis**:
- Who are the primary users affected by this problem?
- What are their current workflows or processes?
- How do they currently handle this problem?
- What would motivate them to adopt a new solution?
- How would you reach these users for validation?

### 2. Problem Evidence Gathering

#### Evidence Collection
**AI Prompt**: "Help identify ways to gather evidence that this problem actually exists."

**Evidence Sources**:
- **Personal Experience**: Your own encounters with this problem
- **User Interviews**: Direct conversations with potential users
- **Observation**: Watching people encounter this problem
- **Data Analysis**: Usage patterns, support tickets, forum discussions
- **Market Research**: Existing solutions, competitor analysis
- **Expert Input**: Industry professionals, domain experts

**Validation Activities** (time-boxed for solo developers):
- Conduct 2-3 quick user conversations or use personal experience
- Quick research of existing solutions (15-30 minutes)
- Analyze current problem-solving approaches
- Use available data or simple online research

#### Problem Significance Assessment
**AI Prompt**: "Help assess whether this problem is significant enough to build a solution."

**Significance Criteria**:
- **Frequency**: How often do users encounter this problem?
- **Impact**: How much pain/cost does this problem cause?
- **Urgency**: How badly do users need this solved?
- **Reach**: How many potential users are affected?
- **Willingness to Pay**: Would users pay for a solution?

### 3. Market and Competitive Analysis

#### Existing Solutions Research
**AI Prompt**: "Help research what solutions already exist for this problem."

**Competitive Landscape**:
- What tools/services currently address this problem?
- How well do existing solutions work?
- What are the gaps or limitations in current solutions?
- Why might users be dissatisfied with existing options?
- What would differentiate a new solution?

#### Market Opportunity Assessment
**AI Prompt**: "Help assess the market opportunity for solving this problem."

**Market Questions**:
- Is this market growing, stable, or declining?
- Are there recent changes that make this problem more important?
- What trends might affect the relevance of this problem?
- Is there room for a new solution in this space?

### 4. Problem Validation Testing

#### Validation Methodology
**AI Prompt**: "Design a systematic approach to validate this problem with real users."

**Validation Approaches**:
- **Problem Interviews**: Focus on understanding the problem, not pitching solutions
- **Observation Studies**: Watch users encounter the problem naturally
- **Survey Validation**: Quantify problem frequency and impact
- **Expert Validation**: Get input from domain experts
- **Market Validation**: Analyze existing solution adoption and satisfaction

#### Validation Script Template
**Problem Interview Questions**:
1. "Tell me about the last time you encountered [problem area]"
2. "What was frustrating about that experience?"
3. "How do you currently handle [specific situation]?"
4. "What would need to change for that to work better?"
5. "How much time/money does this problem cost you?"
6. "If there was a solution to this, what would success look like?"

### 5. Problem Validation Analysis

#### Evidence Synthesis
**AI Prompt**: "Help analyze and synthesize the validation evidence collected."

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Problem Confirmation**: Does evidence confirm the problem exists?
- **User Validation**: Do target users actually experience this problem?
- **Significance Validation**: Is the problem important enough to solve?
- **Market Validation**: Is there opportunity for a new solution?
- **Timing Validation**: Is now the right time to solve this problem?

#### Risk Assessment
**AI Prompt**: "Identify risks and assumptions that still need validation."

**Risk Categories**:
- **Problem Risk**: Is this a real problem or just a perceived one?
- **Market Risk**: Are enough people affected to make this viable?
- **Solution Risk**: Can this problem actually be solved effectively?
- **Timing Risk**: Are there external factors that affect timing?
- **Resource Risk**: Do you have capability to solve this problem?
