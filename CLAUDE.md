# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a workflow repository for building projects with Claude Code using a phased approach. The workflow emphasizes:

- **Walking Skeleton First**: Deploy minimal working versions to production early
- **Minimal Viable Changes (MVC)**: Focus on small, viable incremental changes rather than large features
- **Product Development Flow**: Follow structured phases with clear artifacts and questions to answer
- **AI-Assisted Questioning**: Use AI to ask series of targeted questions to drive each phase forward
- **Structured Documentation**: Maintain predictable documentation structure across projects

## Workflow Philosophy

The workflow is based on GitLab's Product Development Flow, scaled down for single-developer + AI collaboration. Each phase should:

1. Have clear goals and meta-questions to answer
2. Produce specific artifacts before moving to next phase
3. Balance thorough planning with forward momentum
4. Be manageable by one person with AI assistance

## CRITICAL: Research-Driven Development

**ALWAYS reference the research papers when designing workflow components:**

- `research-papers/gitlab-product-development-flow.md`: GitLab's validation â†’ build track methodology, phase structure, and question frameworks
- `research-papers/walking-skeleton-methodology.md`: Minimal end-to-end implementation principles and technical validation approaches
- `research-papers/gitlab-new-vs-existing-systems.md`: Different approaches for greenfield vs brownfield development
- `research-papers/solo-developer-documentation-strategy.md`: Lean documentation principles scaled for 1 developer + AI
- `research-papers/ai-workflow-documentation-patterns.md`: AI agent collaboration patterns and structured prompt frameworks
- `research-papers/in-repo-vs-external-documentation.md`: Documentation platform strategies with 2025 AI tool context

When creating templates, phases, or workflows, explicitly cite relevant research findings to ensure methodological consistency and evidence-based design decisions.

## Project Structure

Research foundation:
- `braindump.md`: Core workflow concepts and ideology
- `research-papers/`: Foundational methodologies and evidence base
- Workflow templates and phase structures to be developed based on research

## Development Approach

When working on this repository:

1. **Research-First**: Always consult relevant research papers before making design decisions
2. **Evidence-Based Design**: Reference specific findings from research when creating workflow components
3. **Walking Skeleton Projects**: Apply research-backed minimal end-to-end implementation principles
4. **MVC Iterations**: Use GitLab's validation framework for incremental changes
5. **AI Documentation**: Follow 2025 AI-enhanced documentation strategies from research

## Key Considerations

- Scale GitLab's enterprise methodologies to single-developer scope using research findings
- Apply Walking Skeleton principles for technical foundation establishment
- Use solo developer documentation strategies for sustainable maintenance
- Implement AI workflow patterns for enhanced productivity
- Balance planning rigor with execution speed based on research-backed approaches
